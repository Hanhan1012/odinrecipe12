        <p>This unstuffed pepper skillet is much easier to make than actual stuffed peppers but packs just as much flavor.
           A super satisfying and delicious dish.</p>
      <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
          <li>8 ounces mini sweet peppers, sliced crosswise (about 10 peppers, mixed colors)</li>
          <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion </li>
          <li>1 pound lean ground sirloin (90/10) </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic </li>
          <li>1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
          <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce </li>
          <li>¼ cup water </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread (such as Cento) </li>
          <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt </li>
          <li>1 (8.8 ounce) package microwavable white rice (such as Uncle Ben’s), crumbled </li>
          <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend </li>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley </li>
<h2> Directions</h2>
              <ol>
          <li><strong>STEP 1</strong></li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes.
               Add beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook,
               stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water, hoagie spread, and salt.</p>
          <li><strong> STEP 2 </strong></li>
            <p> Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly with sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer,
               and cook until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes, stirring once halfway through to prevent sticking. </p>
          <li><strong>STEP 3</strong></li>
            <p> Uncover, remove from heat, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Re-cover and let sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with basil or parsley. </p>
