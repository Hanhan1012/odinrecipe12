<p> Since this is a tomato-based soup, it is important to offset the acidity with some key ingredients.
   We use a combination of cream, parmesan, and a little sugar to balance the soup.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients for Tomato Basil Soup </h2>
       <ul>
         <li> <strong>Butter </strong> – use unsalted butter to sautee onions. </li>
         <li> <strong>Yellow onion</strong> – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness.</li>
         <li> <strong>Garlic </strong> –  you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves. </li>
         <li> <strong>Crushed tomatoes </strong> –  with their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes. </li>
         <li> <strong>Chicken stock </strong> –  for the best flavor use homemade <em><a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/chicken-stock-chicken-bone-broth/"> chicken broth.</a></em>  </li>
        <li> <strong>Basil </strong> –  chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve.
                                        Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips. </li>
        <li> <strong>Sugar  </strong> –  It’s just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.  </li>
        <li> <strong>Black pepper</strong> – start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste   </li>
        <li> <strong>Whipping cream </strong> – adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity. </li>
        <li> <strong>Parmesan cheese </strong> – adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don’t add more.   </li>
      </ul>
    <h2> How to Make Tomato Soup </h2>
      <ol>
          <li> <strong> Saute Aromatics </strong> -heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min).
                                                    Add minced garlic and saute another minute. </li>
          <li> <strong> Make the tomato soup base </strong> - tir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper.
                                                              Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes. </li>
          <li> <strong>Blend if desired </strong> - use an <em><a href= "https://amzn.to/3yAmZHe"> immersion blender </a></em>in the pot or blend in batches using a <em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008TVERZ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?cv_ct_id=amzn1.idea.1IPEJWJ6FO7MD&cv_ct_pg=storefront&cv_ct_wn=aip-storefront&ref=exp_cov_natashaskitchen_dp_vv_d&linkCode=sl1&tag=natashaskcom-20&linkId=d74a37eef24ec47338a6f1b301b00e4d&language=en_US"> blender</a> </em> (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
          <li> <strong> Add cream and parmesan</strong> - stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.</li>
          <li> <strong>Serve </strong> -ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil. </li>
        </ol>
